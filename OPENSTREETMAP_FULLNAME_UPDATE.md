# OpenStreetMap Full Name Display Update

## Overview
Added full name display to the OpenStreetMap popup to show driver information along with vehicle details.

## Changes Made

### 1. VehiclePositionsMap.js - Main OpenStreetMap Component

#### Updated Popup Content
Added driver name display in the vehicle popup:

**Before:**
```javascript
<div className="popup-details">
  <p><strong>Phone:</strong> {vehicle.phoneNumber}</p>
  <p><strong>Status:</strong> 
    <span className={`status-text ${status}`}>
      {status.toUpperCase()}
    </span>
  </p>
```

**After:**
```javascript
<div className="popup-details">
  <p><strong>Driver:</strong> {vehicle.fullName || 'Unknown Driver'}</p>
  <p><strong>Phone:</strong> {vehicle.phoneNumber}</p>
  <p><strong>Status:</strong> 
    <span className={`status-text ${status}`}>
      {status.toUpperCase()}
    </span>
  </p>
```

### 2. MapDemo.js - Demo Component Updates

#### Added Full Names to Demo Data
Updated demo vehicles to include full names:
- CAR001 - John Doe
- CAR002 - Jane Smith  
- CAR003 - Mike Johnson
- CAR004 - Sarah Wilson

#### Updated Demo Properties
Added missing properties for proper demo functionality:
- `fullName` - Driver's full name
- `locationTrackingEnabled: true` - Enable location tracking
- `isDriving: true` - Set driving status

#### Updated Legend
Corrected distance thresholds in demo description:
- Green: Safe distance (>10m)
- Yellow: Warning zone (7-10m)  
- Red: Collision risk (<7m)

## Popup Display Order

The OpenStreetMap popup now shows information in this order:
1. **Vehicle ID** (with "YOU" badge for current user)
2. **Driver Name** (new addition)
3. **Phone Number**
4. **Status** (SAFE/WARNING/COLLISION/NO-GPS)
5. **Coordinates** (latitude, longitude)
6. **Accuracy** (GPS accuracy in meters)
7. **Nearest Vehicle** (distance to closest vehicle)
8. **Last Update** (timestamp)
9. **Simulated Location** (if applicable)
10. **Driving Status** (Yes/Stopped)

## User Experience Improvements

### Better Vehicle Identification
- Users can now see both vehicle ID and driver name
- Easier to identify vehicles in fleet scenarios
- More personal and user-friendly display

### Fallback Handling
- Shows "Unknown Driver" if fullName is not available
- Graceful handling of missing data
- Backward compatibility with existing data

### Demo Enhancement
- Demo now shows realistic driver names
- Proper demonstration of all features
- Correct threshold values displayed

## Technical Implementation

### Data Flow
1. Vehicle data includes `fullName` field from database
2. OpenStreetMap component receives vehicle data with full names
3. Popup displays driver name as first detail after vehicle ID
4. Fallback to "Unknown Driver" for missing names

### Styling
- Driver name uses same styling as other popup details
- Consistent with existing popup design
- Bold labels for easy scanning

## Files Modified

1. `client/src/components/VehiclePositionsMap.js` - Added driver name to popup
2. `client/src/components/MapDemo.js` - Updated demo data with full names and correct properties

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Real Data Test**: Verify full names appear in popups with real user data
2. **Demo Test**: Check that demo shows driver names correctly
3. **Fallback Test**: Test with vehicles that don't have full names
4. **Mobile Test**: Ensure popup displays properly on mobile devices
5. **Multiple Users Test**: Verify all users show their respective full names

## Visual Result

The popup now displays:
```
🚗 CAR101 [YOU]
Driver: John Doe
Phone: +1234567890
Status: SAFE
Coordinates: 
📍 12.742918, 75.503904
Accuracy: ±64m
Last Update:
8/27/2025, 4:13:27 PM
Driving: 🚗 Yes
```

This enhancement makes the OpenStreetMap more informative and user-friendly by clearly identifying both the vehicle and its driver.
